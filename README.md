# Union 250

A discipline tracker in two levels, 500 days in total.

Log two things each night — whether you stayed clean, and your iPhone screen time.
**Level 1** maps 250 days onto 250 years of American history and assembles the United
States state by state, in the order each one actually joined the Union. **Level 2** opens
on day 250 and lights up fifty American inventions, from Franklin's lightning rod in 1752
to the iPhone in 2007.

Everything runs in the browser. No account, no server, no build step, no database.

## Put it on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public is fine).
2. Upload **everything in this folder**, keeping the folder structure exactly as it is.
   The quickest way is GitHub's web uploader: **Add file → Upload files**, then drag the
   whole contents in. You can also use git:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Union 250"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/YOUR-REPO.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, pick **Deploy from a branch**. Choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
5. Save. After a minute or two the site is live at
   `https://YOUR-NAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`.

Add it to your iPhone home screen (Share → Add to Home Screen) and it opens full-screen
like an app.

### Two things that matter

- **Keep `.nojekyll`.** It is an empty file, and it is already included. Without it GitHub
  can mangle folder names and your photos will 404.
- **Do not rename the `assets` or `js` folders.** All the paths are relative and expect
  the layout below.

```

Total size is about 33 MB, nearly all of it photography. Every image was resized and
re-encoded — down from 123 MB originally — so the site loads quickly over mobile data.

## How the game works

**The run.** 500 logged days across two levels.

**Level 1 — The Union.** Days 1–250. Day 1 is 1776, day 250 is 2026. Every 5 days you log,
one state joins the Union — *whether the day went well or badly*. 50 unlocks × 5 days =
exactly 250. Washington, D.C. is on the map from day one. States arrive in order of
admission, so Delaware comes first and Hawaii last.

**Level 2 — The Hall of Innovation.** Days 251–500, unlocked automatically when Level 1
ends. Same rhythm: every 5 logged days lights one of fifty American inventions, in the
order they were invented. The hero counter walks forward from 1752 to 2007 as you go.
Inventions can be filtered by category, and each one opens a full story.

**Scoring.** Six metrics move together each day:

| Day | Points to every metric |
|---|---|
| Clean, under 2 hours | **+30** |
| Clean, under 3 hours | **+15** |
| Clean, under 4 hours | **+5** |
| Clean, 4 hours or more | 0 |
| Relapsed, any screen time | **−30** |

The hour thresholds are editable in Settings — change them and every past day is
rescored instantly.

**The six metrics are real — and they are a journey.** Each one tracks a published
international indicator. You do not start at America's figure; you start at the *world
floor*, roughly where the weakest-performing country sits today, and build upward.

| Metric | Indicator (source) | You start at | America today | Beyond |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GDP | Nominal GDP (IMF, Apr 2026) | $0.05T | **$32.38T** | $50T |
| Human Development | HDI (UNDP HDR 2025) | 0.300 | **0.938** | 1.000 |
| Military Power | Global Firepower Index 2026 | 6.0000 | **0.0741** | 0.0000 |
| Global Reputation | Soft Power Index (Brand Finance 2026) | 15.0 | **74.9** | 100 |
| Technology | Global Innovation Index (WIPO 2025) | 15.0 | **61.7** | 70.0 |
| Education | PISA mean (OECD 2022) | 329 | **489** | 600 |

*(Military is the one where lower is stronger — Global Firepower calls 0.0000 perfect.)*

**The standard, in one line: 250 flawless days reaches America exactly as it really is,
and the next 250 push past it.** A perfect day is 30 points, so 250 of them is 7,500 —
the halfway mark, drawn as a gold tick on every progress bar. The full 500-day run is
15,000 points. World ranks climb the same way: from last place, to America's real rank at
the halfway mark, then on toward first.

Tap any metric card for the full breakdown — where you began, your projection now,
America's real published figure, the stretch beyond it, and the source. The real figures
never move; your points move only the projection.

**Winning.** Reaching day 250 crowns the United States the greatest country in the world,
regardless of how the points fell along the way, and opens Level 2. Day 500 finishes
everything: 101 unlocked dossiers, nothing sealed. Showing up is the win condition.

## Features

- **Today** — log the day in two taps, with a live preview of what it is worth.
- **Calendar** — month grid, week list, and a 250-cell view of the entire run. Tap any
  past day to fill it in or change it. Stars mark the days that unlocked a state.
- **Progress** — screen time bar chart (7 / 30 / 90 / all days) with your target lines
  drawn on it, a breakdown of day types, the power index curve, and personal records.
- **The Union** — two halves. The real US map, where tapping any state that has joined
  opens a dossier of ten paragraphs on its history, culture, food, economy and people,
  plus photographs. And the **Hall of Innovation**, which stays sealed with a live progress
  bar until day 250, then fills with fifty inventions you can filter and read.
- **Guide** — how to use it, the scoring rules, six things to do when an urge hits, an
  FAQ, and fifteen talks from Americans worth listening to.
- **Every photograph opens full** — tap any picture in a state dossier, an invention story
  or the pride gallery and it opens whole and uncropped, scaled to fit your screen exactly.
  Tap again to cycle through three zoom levels, then drag to look around at full
  resolution. Arrows, arrow keys or a swipe walk the rest of the set. Cards still crop to
  keep the grids tidy; the viewer never changes the page underneath it.
- **Settings** — name, start date, editable hour targets, dark / light / auto theme, five
  accent colours, sound, reduced motion, and backup export/import.

## Privacy

Your log never leaves your device. It lives in your browser's local storage under the key
`union250.v1`.

The fifteen videos are embedded through **youtube-nocookie.com**, and nothing is requested
from YouTube until you actually press play on one — the cards you see before that are
drawn locally.

**Back up your data** with Settings → Export backup before clearing your browser data,
switching browsers, or changing phones. It saves a small `.json` file you can import again
later.

## Credits

State photography and the state write-ups were supplied with the project. The base map is
the public-domain *Blank map of the United States*, rebuilt here so each state is
individually tappable and D.C. is large enough to hit with a thumb.

Colour is taken straight from the flag: Old Glory Blue and Old Glory Red on a navy field,
with star white and a gilt gold reserved for unlocks and honours. The day ledger runs on
blue intensity — the brighter the blue, the better the day — with red for a reset. Flag
stripes, star fields and pressed-metal seals are all drawn in CSS, so the decoration costs
no extra downloads.

Typography: **Public Sans** (the US federal government's typeface), **Big Shoulders
Display** (in the spirit of WPA national-park signage), and **IBM Plex Mono** for figures.
